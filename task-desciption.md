# Frontend Technical Task

You need to create a user-friendly and intuitive student website interface that interacts with the backend API to perform CRUD operations on student records. The website should be designed to cater to administrators initially, with appropriate functionality and views for this role.

### Administrator View:

- As an administrator, you should have access to full CRUD functionality for managing student records.
- Design a clean and organized dashboard interface where administrators can:

  1. Create new student records with all relevant information fields.
  2. View a list of all students with options to edit or delete each record.

- Clicking on a student's entry should display their details in an editable form for updating.
- Ensure that administrators have access to all fields when creating or editing student records.

Note: Can you think about how you would design it in a way that you can add further read-only user roles?
